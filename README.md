# Loblaws-Assignment

-This application should pull JSON data from the following: https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/.json ✔️

-The data should be serialized into some kind of type safe object or objects ✔️

-The 'main' view must pass the article 'object' in some way to the 'article view' ✔️

-The app should be tested to run on a real iPhone / iPod device- meaning auto-layout works on different size devices as intended and ATS set up correctly and safely ✔️

-The codebase should be written entirely using Swift, build for iOS 12.x ✔️

-You must upload your completed code to a public Github repository and send us the link! ✔️

(I have init a Podfile with ReactiveCocoa just in case i need it for later for the in person interview)
